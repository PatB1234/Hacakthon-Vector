Step-by-Step Breakdown
1️⃣ Hacker Logs into a Fake Admin Account
The attacker finds and tries to log in using a fake admin account created by AI.
The system does not immediately block the login—instead, it allows the attacker to think they succeeded.

2️⃣ AI Monitors & Logs Attacker Behavior
Every action taken by the attacker is logged:
Commands executed
Files accessed
Network connections made
Changes attempted in system settings
The AI analyzes the behavior to classify it as reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

3️⃣ Fake Success & Deception (Honeypot Mode)
The system generates fake success messages when the hacker tries privileged actions, such as:
"Access granted to critical files" → but the files are fake.
"User permissions updated successfully" → but nothing actually changes.
The attacker believes they are making progress while AI gathers intel.

4️⃣ AI Determines Threat Level & Triggers Countermeasures
If high-risk actions are detected (e.g., trying to modify security settings), the system can:
Revoke all real admin access (so the hacker can't do damage).
Lock down sensitive systems.
Redirect the hacker to a fake admin panel (honeytrap).

5️⃣ Final Containment & Lockout
The system logs out the attacker, blocks their IP address/device fingerprint, and alerts security teams.
Forensic logs are stored for analysis.
