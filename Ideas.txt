BACKUPS:
Passwordle
Honeypot(Quarantining suspicious thinngs)



IDEAS:
Offline website for countering DOS
Offline website using deepseek offline verison. 
/admin with a username and a password path so that permission escalation problem is solved
Zero day exploits
use Gemini API for the Ai part of it
Possibly BlackBox API rather than gemini


AI presentation notes(Existing uses of AI in cyberse):
- Intrusion and anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence and malware analysis
- Physhing detection and email security

- Data qualaity and availability
- Explainability and transparency
- Regulation, ethics and privacy
- Data sharing, model interpretability and real-time detection.

AI-Powered "Ghost Access" ‚Äì Fake Admin Accounts That Detect & Neutralize Hackers (STRIDE: Elevation of Privilege)
Concept:
Hackers often create fake admin accounts to gain long-term access to a system. What if we reverse the tactic‚Äîusing AI-generated fake admin accounts to bait attackers, track them, and shut them down automatically?

Ghost Access is an AI-driven system that automatically creates realistic but non-functional admin accounts. These decoy accounts look real, even passing automated security scans, but any attempt to use them instantly triggers AI-based countermeasures.

How It Works:
AI-Generated Fake Admins (via API calls to Active Directory, AWS, etc.)

When a system is deployed, AI creates fake admin accounts with believable usernames, activity history, and permissions.
These accounts appear legitimate in system logs but have zero real privileges‚Äîthey exist only as traps.
AI-Powered Intrusion Detection

If an attacker tries to log in using one of these accounts, AI flags the attempt as malicious.
Instead of blocking immediately, the system lets the hacker think they‚Äôve succeeded and begins monitoring their actions.
Automated Containment & Countermeasures

AI tracks every command or action, mapping out the attack method.
The system can then auto-revoke actual admin access, lock down critical systems, or deploy misleading fake data to misdirect the attacker.
If needed, AI can even automatically generate a fake "error" message to make the hacker believe their exploit failed, preventing them from trying another method.
Why This Stands Out
Creative Yet Simple: Uses AI to generate fake access points rather than just detecting intrusions.
High Impact: Turns privilege escalation into an opportunity to neutralize threats without attackers realizing.
STRIDE Relevance (Elevation of Privilege): Directly targets unauthorized privilege escalation by baiting and trapping attackers.
Easy Prototype:
Use a simple API to create fake user accounts.
Show a demo where an attacker thinks they gained admin access, but AI detects and shuts them down automatically.
Engaging Presentation: Live demo of a hacker trying to log in to a convincing fake admin account, only for AI to silently neutralize them.
